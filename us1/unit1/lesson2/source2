  <h1>Columbus Reports on His First Voyage (1493)</h1>
  <h2>Part 1</h2>

  <p>
    This is part of a letter written by 
    <span class="term">Columbus
      <span class="popup">Christopher Columbus, an Italian navigator who sailed for Spain in 1492.</span>
    </span> 
    to the 
    <span class="term">king and queen of Spain
      <span class="popup">King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who funded Columbus’s voyages.</span>
    </span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 
    <span class="term">thirty-third day
      <span class="popup">Columbus left Cádiz, Spain, on August 3, 1492, and sighted land on October 12—about 33 days of sailing.</span>
    </span> 
    after leaving 
    <span class="term">Cadiz
      <span class="popup">A port city in southwestern Spain, from where Columbus set sail.</span>
    </span> 
    I came into the 
    <span class="term">Indian Sea
      <span class="popup">Columbus believed he had reached islands off the coast of Asia, which Europeans called the “Indies.”</span>
    </span>, 
    where I discovered many islands inhabited by numerous people. 
    I 
    <span class="term">took possession
      <span class="popup">Claimed the land for Spain, despite the presence of Indigenous peoples.</span>
    </span> 
    of all of them for our most fortunate King by making public proclamation and unfurling his 
    <span class="term">standard
      <span class="popup">The royal flag of Spain, symbolizing Spanish authority.</span>
    </span>, 
    no one making any resistance.
