  <h1>Columbus Reports on His First Voyage, 1493 - Part 5</h1>
  <p>This is part of a letter written by Columbus to the king and queen of Spain.</p>
  <p>I have determined to write you this letter to inform you of everything that has been done and discovered in this voyage of mine.</p>
  <p>
    I gave them many beautiful and pleasing things, which I had brought with me, for no return whatever, in order to win their affection, and that they might become Christians and inclined to love our King and Queen and Princes and all the people of Spain; and that they might be eager to search for and gather and give to us what they have in and we greatly need.
