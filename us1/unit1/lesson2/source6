<h1>Columbus Reports on His First Voyage, 1493 - Part 5</h1>

<p>I gave them many beautiful and pleasing 
  <span class="term">things
    <span class="popup">Gifts, items, or goods presented to someone.</span>
  </span>, which I had brought with me, for no return whatever, in order to win their 
  <span class="term">affection
    <span class="popup">Fondness or care for others.</span>
  </span>, and that they might become 
  <span class="term">Christians
    <span class="popup">Followers of Christianity, the religion based on the teachings of Jesus Christ.</span>
  </span> and inclined to love our 
  <span class="term">King and Queen
    <span class="popup">Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, who sponsored Columbusâ€™s voyages.</span>
  </span> and 
  <span class="term">Princes
    <span class="popup">Members of the royal family of Spain.</span>
  </span> and all the people of Spain; and that they might be eager to search for, gather, and give to us what they have and we greatly need.
