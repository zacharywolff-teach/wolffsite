<h1>Columbus Reports on His First Voyage, 1493 - Part 4</h1>

<p>But when they see that they are safe, and all fear is banished, they are very 
  <span class="term">guileless
    <span class="popup">Innocent, sincere, and without deceit.</span>
  </span> and 
  <span class="term">honest
    <span class="popup">Truthful and fair in dealings with others.</span>
  </span>, and very liberal of all they have. No one refuses the asker anything that he possesses; on the contrary they themselves invite us to ask for it. They manifest the greatest 
  <span class="term">affection
    <span class="popup">Fondness or care for others.</span>
  </span> towards all of us, exchanging 
  <span class="term">valuable things
    <span class="popup">Items of worth, such as gold, jewelry, or goods.</span>
  </span> for trifles, content with the very least thing or nothing at all.
