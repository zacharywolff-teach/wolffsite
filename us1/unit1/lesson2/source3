<h1>Columbus Reports on His First Voyage, 1493 - Part 2</h1>

<p>In the island, which I have said before was called 
  <span class="term">Hispaniola
    <span class="popup">The Caribbean island where Columbus established his first European settlement in 1492, now Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</span>
  </span>, there are very lofty and beautiful 
  <span class="term">mountains
    <span class="popup">Tall natural elevations of the earthâ€™s surface, often forming ranges.</span>
  </span>, great 
  <span class="term">farms
    <span class="popup">Areas of land cultivated for growing crops and raising livestock.</span>
  </span>, groves and fields, most fertile both for 
  <span class="term">cultivation
    <span class="popup">Preparing and using land for crops and agriculture.</span>
  </span> and for 
  <span class="term">pasturage
    <span class="popup">Land used for grazing animals.</span>
  </span>, and well adapted for constructing buildings. The convenience of the 
  <span class="term">harbors
    <span class="popup">Sheltered areas along the coast where ships can safely anchor.</span>
  </span> in this island, and the excellence of the 
  <span class="term">rivers
    <span class="popup">Natural streams of water flowing toward seas or lakes, useful for drinking, transport, and agriculture.</span>
  </span>, in volume and salubrity, surpass human belief, unless one should see them. Besides, this Hispaniola abounds in various kinds of 
  <span class="term">species
    <span class="popup">Different kinds of plants, animals, or minerals.</span>
  </span>, 
  <span class="term">gold
    <span class="popup">A precious metal highly valued for its rarity and use in currency and ornaments.</span>
  </span> and 
  <span class="term">metals
    <span class="popup">Elements like iron, silver, and copper, used for tools, weapons, and trade.</span>
  </span>.
