    Although few textbooks today use the word 
    <span class="term">"primitive"
      <span class="popup">An outdated word once used to describe early societies, now avoided because it suggests inferiority.</span>
    </span> 
    to describe pre-contact 
    <span class="term">Native Americans
      <span class="popup">Indigenous peoples of North America before the arrival of Europeans.</span>
    </span>, 
    many still give the impression that they were a simple, small group of people that only 
    <span class="term">hunted
      <span class="popup">To pursue and kill animals for food.</span>
    </span> 
    and 
    <span class="term">fished
      <span class="popup">To catch fish for food.</span>
    </span> 
    without changing the 
    <span class="term">wilderness
      <span class="popup">Land in a natural state, not significantly altered by humans.</span>
    </span> 
    around them. As we shall see, this view is incorrect; in fact, Native American societies were 
    <span class="term">diverse
      <span class="popup">Full of variety and differences.</span>
    </span>, 
    and complicated.

    Food discovered and 
    <span class="term">domesticated
      <span class="popup">The process of adapting wild plants or animals for human use.</span>
    </span> 
    by Native Americans would transform the diet of Europe and Asia. Native Americans also made many important contributions to modern 
    <span class="term">medicine
      <span class="popup">The science of healing and treating illness.</span>
    </span>, 
    <span class="term">art
      <span class="popup">The expression of human creativity through visual, musical, or performance forms.</span>
    </span>, 
    and 
    <span class="term">architecture
      <span class="popup">The design and construction of buildings and structures.</span>
    </span>.
