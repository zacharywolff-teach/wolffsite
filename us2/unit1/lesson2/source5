  “The length of the factory girl’s work day varies from a legal limit of eight hours in one or two advanced states to ten, eleven, or twelve in less enlightened communities; in some states where the law still fails to protect women from industrial exploitation the hours are regulated only by the needs of the industry. In Pennsylvania, the law prescribes a limit of twelve hours daily and sixty hours weekly for women over eighteen; for girls under that age the law restricts this further. 
  One worker, <span class="term">Lena R.
    <span class="popup">A young silk mill worker, only 14 years old, who worked long hours.</span>
  </span>, started night work at age eleven.

  One of the most striking evils is the lack of 
  <span class="term">seats
    <span class="popup">Workers were required to stand all day; very few mills provided seating.</span>
  </span> in factories, causing strain on young girls’ growing bodies. Employers also covered the lower sashes of windows with paint so they could not be raised in hot weather, ensuring girls “don’t waste time looking out.”
