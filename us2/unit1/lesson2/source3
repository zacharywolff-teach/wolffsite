Source D: Abuses in City Government<br>
Lincoln Steffens, a leading muckraker, exposed political corruption in American cities. Read the following excerpt and list abuses in city government that Steffens implies.
</p>

<p>
<span class="term">Boss
  <span class="popup">A person who controls a faction or local branch of a political party; may not hold official office.</span>
</span>: A boss is a person who controls a faction or local branch of a political party. They do not necessarily hold public office themselves.

“When I went to Cincinnati…I sought out 
<span class="term">Boss Cox
  <span class="popup">The political boss of Cincinnati described by Steffens, representing corruption in city government.</span>
</span>. His office was over his “Mecca” saloon, in a mean little front hall room one flight up. The door was open. I saw a great 
<span class="term">hulk
  <span class="popup">A large, imposing person; here describing the boss.</span>
</span> of a man, sitting alone, his back to the door, his feet up on the window sill; he was reading a newspaper. I walked in; he did not look up. “Mr. Cox?” I said. An affirmative grunt. “Mr. Cox, I understand that you were the boss of Cincinnati.” Slowly his feet came down, one by one. They slowly walked his chair around, and a stolid face turned to let two dark sharp eyes study me.  

While they measured, I gave my name and explained that I was a “student of 
<span class="term">politics
  <span class="popup">The activities associated with governing a city, state, or country, including corruption.</span>
</span>, corrupt politics, and bosses.” I repeated that I had heard he was the boss of Cincinnati. “Are you?” I asked. “I am,” he grumbled in his hoarse, throaty voice.  

“Of course you have a 
<span class="term">mayor
  <span class="popup">The elected head of a city government.</span>
</span>, and a 
<span class="term">council
  <span class="popup">A group of elected officials who make decisions for the city.</span>
</span>, and 
<span class="term">judges
  <span class="popup">Officials who preside over courts and legal matters.</span>
</span>?” “I have,” he admitted, “but” – he pointed with his thumb back over his shoulder to the desk – “I have a 
<span class="term">telephone
  <span class="popup">Used metaphorically here to show power and influence.</span>
</span>, too.”  

“And you have citizens, too, in your city? American men and women?” He stared a long moment, silent, then turned heavily back to his paper. That short interview was a summary of the truth about Cincinnati.
