<h1>Abuses in the Meat-Packing Industry</h1>
<p class="caption">
Source C: Abuses in the Meat-Packing Industry<br>
Upton Sinclair, in his best-selling book <em>The Jungle</em>, described conditions in the meat-packing industry. Read and list the abuses described.

<p>
“There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for 
<span class="term">sausage
  <span class="popup">Ground and mixed meat product, often made from scraps and leftovers.</span>
</span>; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been 
<span class="term">rejected
  <span class="popup">Discarded or deemed unsuitable for consumption.</span>
</span>, and that was moldy and white—it would be dosed with 
<span class="term">borax
  <span class="popup">A chemical preservative sometimes used in food, now unsafe.</span>
</span> and 
<span class="term">glycerine
  <span class="popup">A chemical substance used in food preservation or processing.</span>
</span>, and dumped into the 
<span class="term">hoppers
  <span class="popup">Large containers used to hold and feed meat into machines.</span>
</span>, and made over again for home consumption.  

There would be meat that had tumbled out on the 
<span class="term">floor
  <span class="popup">The ground of the factory, often dirty and unsanitary.</span>
</span>, in the dirt and 
<span class="term">sawdust
  <span class="popup">Wood shavings used on the floor, which became contaminated with germs.</span>
</span>, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of 
<span class="term">consumption germs
  <span class="popup">Pathogens that can cause disease in humans.</span>
</span>. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of 
<span class="term">rats
  <span class="popup">Rodents contaminating food and spreading disease.</span>
</span> would race about on it.  

It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried 
<span class="term">dung
  <span class="popup">Excrement from rats or other animals, contaminating food.</span>
</span>. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.  

There was no place for the men to 
<span class="term">wash their hands
  <span class="popup">Clean their hands before eating or handling food.</span>
</span> before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage. There were the 
<span class="term">butt-ends
  <span class="popup">Remaining pieces or scraps of meat products.</span>
</span> of smoked meat, and the scraps of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants that would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there.  

Under the system of rigid 
<span class="term">economy
  <span class="popup">Strict cost-cutting measures that reduced cleanliness and safety.</span>
</span> enforced by the packers, some jobs were only done once in a long time, such as cleaning out the waste barrels. Every spring they did it; in the barrels would be dirt, rust, old nails, and stale water, which would then be dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat.  

Some of it would be made into 
<span class="term">smoked sausage
  <span class="popup">Sausage that has been flavored and preserved by smoking, often done improperly here.</span>
</span>, and the chemistry department would preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to make it brown. All sausage came out of the same bowl, but when wrapped, some was stamped “special” and charged extra.”
